The Health Monitoring App is an Oracle APEX application that integrates with Strava API. The app will allow users to track their physical activities, such as running, cycling, and swimming. Users will be able to monitor their performance, view activity history, and analyze their progress over time. The app will retrieve activity data (e.g., distance, duration, calories burned) from Strava API, which will be displayed in interactive dashboards, charts, and reports within Oracle APEX.
