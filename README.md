# Health Monitoring App

The **Health Monitoring App** is an Oracle APEX application that integrates with the Strava API. The app allows users to track their physical activities, such as running, cycling, and swimming. Users can monitor their performance, view activity history, and analyze their progress over time. The app retrieves activity data (e.g., distance, duration, calories burned) from the Strava API, and this data is displayed in interactive dashboards, charts, and reports within Oracle APEX.

## Requirements

The following PL/SQL packages are **required** for the application to function correctly:

- **[Logger Log PL/SQL](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger)**: A lightweight and efficient logging framework for PL/SQL used to log application processes and errors for debugging and audit purposes.
  
- **[utPLSQL](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL)**: A unit testing framework for PL/SQL used to validate the correctness and reliability of the codebase through automated tests.

Please ensure these packages are installed in your Oracle environment before running the application.
